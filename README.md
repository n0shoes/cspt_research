## The Core Insight

Every modern frontend framework decodes URL parameters before passing them to developer code. When decoded params flow into `fetch()` calls, the browser normalizes `../` sequences *before* the HTTP request leaves — creating path traversal that bypasses server-side protections entirely.

**Three things that make CSPT universal:**

1. **No JavaScript encoding function encodes dots.** `encodeURIComponent('..') === '..'` — traversal survives all encoding.
2. **`fetch()` normalizes `../` before sending.** `fetch('/api/users/../../admin')` sends `GET /admin`. The browser does this, not the framework.
3. **Server-side rendering turns CSPT into SSRF.** Next.js Server Components, Remix loaders, SvelteKit `+page.server.ts` — all execute `fetch()` on the server with internal credentials and network access.

## Quick Reference Matrix

| Framework | Params decoded? | `%2f` → `/` in params? | Double-encode? | Catch-all slashes? | Route breaks on `%2f`? |
|-----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **React Router v7** | Yes | Yes | Yes (two-step) | Yes (`*` splat) | Yes |
| **Next.js App Router** | Client: re-encoded / Server: Yes | Client: No / Server: Yes | Version-dependent | Yes (`[...slug]`) | Depends on route type |
| **Remix** | Yes (inherits RR) | Yes | Yes | Yes (`$.tsx`) | Yes |
| **Vue Router v4** | Yes | Yes | Not documented | Yes (`/:pathMatch(.*)*`) | Yes |
| **Nuxt 3** | Yes | Yes (via Vue Router) | Version-dependent | Yes | Yes |
| **Angular** | Yes | Yes (in paramMap) | Double-encodes on re-nav | N/A | No (routing preserves) |
| **SvelteKit** | Yes | Historical double-decode | Yes (historical) | Yes (`[...rest]`) | Yes |
| **Ember.js** | Yes | Decoded → breaks route | Not documented | Yes (`/*path`) | Yes |
| **SolidStart** | **No** | **No** | N/A | Yes (`[...path]`) | No |

## Repository Structure

### Research (`*-research/`)

Each framework has a dedicated research directory containing:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `01-route-definitions.md` | Route syntax, minification survival, detection regexes |
| `02-source-to-sink.md` | CSPT sources and sinks with minified patterns |
| `03-encoding-behavior.md` | Decoding pipeline with source code analysis |
| `04-encoding-matrix.md` | Complete encoding test matrix |
| `05-caido-patterns.md` | Regex patterns for automated detection |
| `06-appendix.md` | Source references, lab structure, build analysis |

**Frameworks covered:** React Router, Next.js, Vue Router, Nuxt, Angular, SvelteKit, Astro, Ember.js, SolidStart, Remix

### Labs (`*-cspt-lab/`)

Each lab is a real, runnable application demonstrating CSPT in the target framework.

| Lab | Stack | Key Patterns |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `react-cspt-lab` | React 19, React Router 7, TanStack Query | useParams → fetch, splat routes, dangerouslySetInnerHTML chains |
| `nextjs-cspt-lab` | Next.js 15.3, App Router | Encoding differential: page params (re-encoded) vs route handlers (decoded) |
| `vue-router-cspt-lab` | Vue 3, Vue Router 4, TanStack Vue Query | route.params → fetch, catch-all arrays, encoding split |
| `nuxt-cspt-lab` | Nuxt 3.17, Vue 3 | Island payloads, server routes, H3 |
| `angular-cspt-lab` | Angular 21, @angular/router | paramMap extraction, encoding behaviors |
| `sveltekit-cspt-lab` | SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5 | +page.server.ts loaders, encoding differential |
| `astro-cspt-lab` | Astro 5, @astrojs/node | decodeURI behavior, middleware bypass |
| `ember-cspt-lab` | Ember.js 6, Embroider/Vite | Wildcard routes, triple-curlies, adapters |
| `solidstart-cspt-lab` | SolidStart 1.1, Solid.js 1.9 | createResource, server functions, innerHTML |
| `remix-cspt-lab` | React Router 7 (Framework Mode) | Loaders (decoded), actions, .data endpoint, SSRF |

### Tools

#### `cspt-analyzer` — Caido Plugin

Passive framework detection with client-side path extraction and CSPT sink analysis. Integrates with the [Caido](https://caido.io) HTTP proxy to detect framework fingerprints, extract dynamic route definitions from minified bundles, and identify CSPT source-to-sink chains.

#### `cspt-devtools-extension` — Chrome DevTools Extension

Chrome DevTools panel ("doctorscan") for detecting CSPT patterns directly in the browser. Identifies frameworks, extracts routes, and flags CSPT sources and sinks with per-framework encoding context. No traffic interception required.

### Reference Documents

- **`cspt-framework-notes.md`** — Master reference document (54 KB) covering all frameworks with encoding comparisons, CVEs, and detection patterns
- **`react-cspt-deep-dive.md`** — Detailed empirical analysis of React Router v7 encoding behavior with comprehensive encoding matrix

## Key Findings

### Encoding Differentials

The novel contribution of this research is documenting how each framework's encoding pipeline creates (or prevents) CSPT:

- **React Router v7** double-decodes through `safelyDecodeURI()` + `safelyDecodeURIComponent()` — `%252f` becomes `/`
- **Next.js App Router** re-encodes page params but leaves route handler params decoded — same framework, different attack surface
- **SolidStart** doesn't decode params at all — defense-in-depth by default
- **Astro** uses `decodeURI()` instead of `decodeURIComponent()` — `%2F` preserved, but encoded letters decode (CVE-2025-64765)
- **Vue Router** has the cleanest exploit: `route.params` decoded, `route.path` encoded — consistent and reliable

### CVEs Referenced

| CVE | Framework | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| CVE-2025-64765 | Astro | Middleware bypass via URL-encoded letters (`/%61dmin`) |
| CVE-2025-59414 | Nuxt 3 | Stored CSPT via island payload revival |
| CVE-2025-67647 | SvelteKit | SSRF via `decode_pathname()` vs `url.pathname` discrepancy |
| CVE-2025-29927 | Next.js | Middleware skip via `x-middleware-subrequest` header |
| GHSA-whqg-ppgf-wp8c | Astro | Double-encoding bypass of initial fix |

### Server-Side Amplification

When CSPT occurs in SSR contexts, it becomes SSRF with internal credentials:

- **Remix** loaders execute `fetch()` with server-side auth headers and internal network access
- **SvelteKit** `+page.server.ts` load functions run on the server
- **Next.js** route handlers and Server Components fetch with full server privileges
- **Nuxt** server routes via H3 have access to internal services

## Running the Labs

Each lab is a standalone application. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
# Example: React lab
cd react-cspt-lab
bun install
bun run dev

# Example: Next.js lab
cd nextjs-cspt-lab
bun install
bun run dev
```

Build to production to test detection against minified/bundled code:

```bash
bun run build
```
